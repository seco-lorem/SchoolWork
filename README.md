### CS 315
Explored the concepts of numerous programming languages. Worked with lex and yacc. Introduced to functional programming using Scheme. Languages that got familiarised with include: C, C++, C#, Dart, GoLang, Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Rust. See the course project and an example homework [here](https://github.com/seco-lorem/SchoolWork/tree/main/CS315).
## Sophomore & Freshman Years
### CS 223-224

### CS 201-202
Used C++ to learn about algorithms and Data structures like Hashtable, Graphs and various kinds of Trees. See an example homework [here](https://github.com/seco-lorem/SchoolWork/tree/main/hw4).
### CS 101-102
Used Java to follow the catalog descriptions in the following pages: [101](https://stars.bilkent.edu.tr/syllabus/view/CS/101/20191?section=1) [102](https://stars.bilkent.edu.tr/syllabus/view/CS/102/20192?section=1)\
The repository for the course project with a team of 5, MonitoRING, is private now. See the explanation of it in the [folder](https://github.com/seco-lorem/SchoolWork/tree/main/MonitoRING) with some demo.
