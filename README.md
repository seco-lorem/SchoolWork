# School Work
Some of the computer science related school work in Bilkent University.
## CS 101-102
Used Java to follow the catalog descriptions in the following pages: [101](https://stars.bilkent.edu.tr/syllabus/view/CS/101/20191?section=1) [102](https://stars.bilkent.edu.tr/syllabus/view/CS/102/20192?section=1)\
