# What is Monitoring
Monitoring is an app where bus drivers of Bilkent University log in to share their location data via firebase, and the users can see it on an integrated Google Maps API with routes and bus stops. So the students, teachers and the staff will be able to plan their transportation more efficiently. It is a school project with 5 people, an android app written in Adroid Studio with Java.
# What is done
Core Functionality: Buses can be tracked by passengers.\
Firebase Realtime Database to store the driver information and route information.\
Bus stops of a route(SMD) are added on the passenger's map.\
The Passenger can see where they are, where the bus stops, and where is the bus.
# What is left
UI is not finalised\
Currently, the information regarding one route(SMD) is visible and the values are only test values.\
Currently the user only sees one specific driver for the route. The other possible have to be implemented.\
The routes need to be drawn on map.
